    <h3>Why companies<span>  go public</span>?</h3>
</div>

Companies go public to raise money. It gives them financial capital, that they can use to clear off debts, improve the infrastructure, invest in research and development of new products, introduce new products and so on. Apart from that, the increased financial scrutiny during the process of going public will get them better debt rates when they are issuing it.
<br>
And if the company’s stocks are in demand, there is always scope for mergers and acquisitions. The terms of negotiations can be in stocks. The demand also attracts the company’s top talents as the company can offer stock options as reimbursement. The company gets credibility and visibility after it gets listed on the stock exchange.

<h3>Who are underwriters and <span>  what do they do?</span>?</h3>
</div>
Investment banks send a few representatives to the company who want to sell their shares to the public in the market for the very first time. They work out the complete process for them, to ensure successful entry into the market. The amount of risk the underwriter takes depends on how he is compensated. There are two ways of underwriting.
​<br>

<b> -> Bought deal –  </b>Here the underwriters buy all IPOs from the Company and they resell it to the investing public. The compensation is the difference in the selling and buying price. The entire risk of the IPO listing outcome is borne by the underwriters.<br>
<b> ->Best effort deal – </b>According to this deal, the underwriters make their best efforts to sell the issue to the investing public. They do not purchase any shares from the company. The compensation is fixed. And there is no risk for underwriters, but they will not gain anything even if the shares do well post listing.

<h3>
Lock-up period<br></h3>
<br>
Lock-up periods are usually agreements between the Company offering stocks, the company’s insiders and pre-IPO stockholders which restrict them to sell their shares for a particular time period. This is to protect the public from the pre-IPO holders who want to pawn off their holdings when the IPO is overpriced, which otherwise lead to a market price drop due to the inflow of the shares.
