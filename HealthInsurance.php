</div>

<div class="container size">

You’re spoiled for choice when it comes to buying insurance because of the numerous health plans and covers available today. But you need all the information you can get before buying a medical insurance policy that suits your needs. To make your life simple, we’ve made a short list of factors you must consider while purchasing a policy.
<br>
Here they are:<br>

<b> -> </b>Always opt for adequate cover and ensure that it is sufficient for you and your entire family.<br>

<b> -> </b>Nowadays, most employees are covered by their company’s medical insurance. However, it is always an added benefit to select and purchase your own medical insurance plan after knowing all the terms and conditions.
<br>
<b> -> </b>It’s ideal to combine hospital cash, critical illness and other benefits in your base cover to avail some form of compensation for non-payable losses.
<br>
<b> -> </b>Always inform your insurer about any pre<b> -> </b>existing diseases.
<br>
<b> -> </b>Always keep a note of covers and maximum limits.
<br>
<b> -> </b>A higher sum insured is always better as there is a constant rise in the cost of medical expenses.
<br>
<b> -> </b>It is advisable to check the insurance provider’s claim settlement record. You should always opt for a company with a good settlement record. This ensures that your claims are not wrongly withheld and prevents any unnecessary claim issues in the future.
<br>
<b> -> </b>Renew your policy on a continual basis. If there is a break between the expiry and renewal, you may lose the benefits of the insurance.
<br>
<b> -> </b>Choose an insurance provider that has an internal team to assist with claim and settlement process as they offer a better turnaround time and a seamless process.
<br>
<b> -> </b>Opt for a health insurance company that allows insurance portability. This way you have the benefit to change your insurance company and opt for a medical insurance policy better than your current one.
