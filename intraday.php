How to Go About Intraday Trading
​<span>  Intraday Trading </span>
</h3> <br></div>

It is important to understand the fundamentals of intraday trading in order to make consistent profits. A good tip is to trade with the current market trend. If the market is falling, sell first and buy later, and vice versa. Make an intraday trade plan and stick to the plan. Set your desired profit and stop-loss limit. Do not be greedy. Instead, book your profits at regular intervals. Maintain stop-loss levels. It helps you to limit your loss if the market does not perform. Also, choose highly liquid shares and trade in a small number of shares at a time, if you are not a seasoned trader.

Basic ​<span>  Rules of</span> Intraday Trading

</h3> <br></div>

An unexpected movement can wipe all your investment in a few minutes. Hence, it is important to keep in mind a few intraday trading basics while carrying out intraday trading. Do not trade in the first hour as the opening range is established during that time. The fluctuations of this range can help to identify the intraday trend. Move with the market trend as it allows potential for a greater profit if the trend continues. Another basic rule is to fix entry price and target levels. Set a stop-loss limit so that your losses will be curtailed if the share drops. Also, withdraw if your desired profits are met. Stick to your plan and carry trade in a disciplined manner.

How can I make consistent profits​<span>   using intraday trading?</span> 

</h3> <br></div>

Most traders have a straight and simple goal – to make consistent profits. The best day trading strategy you can implement to achieve this is to buy when the stock moves above the Opening Range high and sell when the stock moves below the Opening Range low. In the first 30 minutes of day trading, each stock creates a range, known as the opening range. The fluctuations of this range are taken as support and resistance. If the stock movement is observed to cross the Opening Range high, then it is advisable to buy. Similarly, you can sell when stock movement is observed below the Opening Range low. This strategy can give you consistent profits if done with discipline, proper assessment of the market performance and optimal usage of indicators.

What is difference between?​<span>    stocks on intraday basis </span> and delivery basis 

</h3> <br></div>


Intraday trading, as the name suggests, is trading stocks within trading hours in a single day. Many new investors and traders are keen to know about how intraday trading works. To begin with, you buy shares when the price is low and sells them when the price is high, thus taking advantage of the price movement. You can use real-time charts to identify these price movements and make profits. On the other hand, if you purchase and hold shares overnight, then you take delivery of shares. This is known as delivery trading. In the delivery method, stocks are transferred to your demat account. You can sell these stocks for either a short-term period (maybe next day) or after a few weeks, months or years. The benefit of intraday trading is that the cost of brokerage is low compared to delivery trading. Also, you receive margin profits the same day as opposed to delivery trading.
