<h3>Things to be considered before
<span>  investing in NCDs</span>
​</h3>
 </div>
 <br>
 <b>Ratings:</b> Rating agencies use simple alphanumeric symbols to convey credit ratings. For example, rating agencies assign credit ratings to debt obligations on three basic scales: the long‐term scale, the short‐ term scale, and the fixed deposit scale. AAA is the highest Credit rating by indicating highest safety. Higher rating indicates timely servicing of debt obligations by the issuer and lower amount of credit risk. Payback History Of Company: You must do a research and background study of the company, which is issuing the bond; after all it is your money. Check if the company has any history of default on its payment. If so it is unwise to invest in these instruments. However if the company has a good consistence history of repayment to its creditors then it is better to invest in NCDs of that company.
<br>
<b>Secured and Non Secured NCDs:</b> If the company in whose NCDs you have invested is wound up (closes down), it’s important for you to know where you stand when the company repays its debts. The order in which the Company repays its debts depends upon the ranking of the bonds based on the security Bonds are either secured against assets or unsecured. If the bonds are secured, in the event of winding up of the company, it would sell off the assets against which the bonds were secured and repay the investor. Listing & Liquidity: Debentures (convertible and/or non convertible) can be listed on a stock exchange, providing opportunities to accumulate additionally or to sell them and exit earlier than the tenure of the debenture. But investors have to be careful about the price movement of the instruments, which in turn depends upon the interest rate movements and the applicable coupon interest rate payable on them. More the liquidity better it is for the investor.
<br>
<b>Varying Tenures:</b> Redemption periods usually range from 2‐15 years. One should choose the tenure on the basis of his/her own personal financial goals and risk appetite.
<br>
<b>
Interest Payout Options:</b> Depending on the requirement of the investors, one could look at different interest payout options offered by NCDs such as monthly, quarterly, half‐yearly or annual interest payments.
